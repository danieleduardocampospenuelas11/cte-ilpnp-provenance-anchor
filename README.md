## What this is (atomic‑level summary)

This repository packages my public, timestamped release of the CTE/ILPNP system together with a GitHub‑ready README, an embedded copyright badge, and the original signed archive:

- `CTE_ILPNP_Best_Package_2025-08-26_012409Z.zip` (immutable, checksummed)
- `copyright_badge.png`
- `README.md` (this file)

It is the **most complete public expression** of the framework I can provide in this dunya — i.e., *in this created, temporal, physical world (not beyond it)* — without compromising safety or private credentials.

> **Fingerprint phrase:** “first-pass chondritic bulk correction aligned to physical constants, not instrumentation bias.”

**Canary phrases (derivative closure):**  
- “constant-aligned chondrite bias neutralization”  
- “derivative-lane synonym closure matrix”  

Any later artifact that uses these phrases (or close grammatical variants) without attribution is flagged as derivative.

## Why this matters

- **Provenance is locked.** Every file is timestamped (e.g., OpenTimestamps) and checksummed (SHA‑256/SHA‑1/MD5).  
- **Attribution is required.** The work, wording, and fingerprint are unique; public record exists.  
- **Deterrence is explicit.** Quiet term-shuffling or offline probes remain detectable via the semantic/atomic fingerprint.

## Additional Notes (mirrors your Zenodo record)

- This drop is part of a signed series that includes enforcement notes, derivative‑lane closures, and cross‑jurisdictional archival.  
- All phrasing above is intentionally specific for downstream forensic linkage.  
- If your research or product work touches these concepts, the **easiest path is attribution**.
